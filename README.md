# Time-Series Forecasting of Engagement Levels

## Project Title
**Multimodal Time-Series Forecasting of Student Engagement Using EEG, Eye-Tracking, and GSR Signals**

---

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting future engagement levels using multimodal time-series data including EEG, eye-tracking, and GSR signals. The goal is to build sequence-to-sequence models (LSTM, GRU, Transformer) that can forecast engagement scores based on past physiological and behavioral signals.
